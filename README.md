# Predicting Quality Wines with Machine Learning

This project uses various Machine Learning modules to make predictions on whether or not a wine will be 'good'. The dataset includes 11 input variables and a quality score for each wine. 

The motivation behind this project was to get some hands-on experience using different machine learning modules. By completing this project, I learned some useful skills, such as:
- how to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), 
- how to check for null values within the dataset, 
- how to use the Seaborn visualization library,
- how to encode output data (as 0 or 1), 
- how to scale input variables into a Z-score,
- how to determine which ML model performs best, and lastly
- how take a ML model and make a prediction. 

I saved my work as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file so it's easy for you to walk through and see the flow of the project.
